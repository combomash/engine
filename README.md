# @combomash/engine

A TypeScript engine for constructing canvas-based render pipelines, offering a framework for rendering realtime or frame based outputs. The engine aims to provide a foundation for crafting deterministic generative artworks, procedural artifacts, and web-based experiences.

## v0.x.x (Alpha)

Please **DO NOT** use this package in production!

This package is being developed in service of my art practice. I may eventually release a v1.0.0 intended for others to use, but until then many (most?) featuers will be missing and you can expect breaking changes. I welcome you to visit my studio website and let me know any thoughts you may have.
