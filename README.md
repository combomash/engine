# @combomash/engine

An opinionated TypeScript engine for constructing and orchestrating canvas-based render pipelines, agnostic to the web rendering techniques employed (e.g., ThreeJS, WebGL, WebGPU, P5). It supports real-time interactivity, frame-based outputs, bucketed and/or progressive methods, and multi-pass rendering via a node-based workflow. The engine aims to provide a foundation for crafting deterministic generative artworks, procedural products, and engaging web-based experiences.

## v0.0.x (Alpha)

Please **DO NOT** use this package in production!

The project is in a very early phase of development and at present, it's sole purpose is in support of my art practice and personal education. Many (most?) features are missing and I expect constant breaking changes between releases. Only use it as reference until v1.0.0 is released.
