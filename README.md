# @combomash/engine

A TypeScript engine for constructing and orchestrating canvas-based render pipelines, agnostic to the web rendering techniques employed (e.g., ThreeJS, WebGL, WebGPU, P5). It supports real-time interactive webapps / games, frame-based outputs, bucketed and/or progressive methods, and multi-pass rendering via node connected pipelines. The engine aims to provide a foundation for crafting deterministic generative artworks, procedural artifacts, and web-based experiences.

## v0.x.x (Alpha)

Please **DO NOT** use this package in production!

This project is entirely in service of my art practice and personal education. I may eventually release a v1.0.0 that could be considered reliable, but until then many (most?) features will be missing and you can expect breaking changes. See what I'm developing with it on my studio website and I welcome you to let me know any thoughts you may have!
